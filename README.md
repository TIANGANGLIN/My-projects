## 1. Multi-Object Tracking Based on Motion Prediction and Occlusion Recovery
### 1.1 Algorithm 

This algorithm is a tracking-by-detection method, and focus on the impact of motion prediction on Object Tracking. Most of current tracking methods concentrate on feature extraction and object detector, and pay less attention on the temporal property of tracking task. .

*I'll add more details when I finish my paper.*

### 1.2 Innovations and difficulties
**Innovations:** 

- Considering the high-order Markov chain and Kalman Smoothing to decrease the uncertainties of bbox caused by the instability of Object Detector. 

- Kalman Prediction is used to predict the states of bboxes of temporary loss.

- For the occluded target, Relative Motion Model and Trajectory Prediction Model are used to recover bboxes' states during their occlusion.

**Difficulties:** 

- Loss of bboxes caused by appearance distortion, lighting changes, fast motion and motion blur, and similar background interference.

- Mismatched trajectories caused by out-of-plane rotation, in-plane rotation, scale changes, occlusion and out of view, etc.

- Current tracking algorithms pay less attention to the trajectory prediction module and cannot predict the possible future collisions of the target

Occlusion processing module can predict the trajectory and speed of the target for a period of time to foresee possible future collisions

## 2. Tracking Based on Correlation Filter

Re- implementation of classic Correlation Filter Based Single Object Tracking algorithm. MOSSE code can be found in my repository.

The most striking advantage of CF based tracking method is its high efficiency. The original MOSSE can achieve 669 FPS. And  many researchers used different features to improve performance, but with little success.

However, the classic CF based tracking methods are only applied to Single Object Tracking. In recent years, some researchers have extended it to multi-target tracking, but this is not a successful extension. In fact, their methods are just multi-SOT rather than MOT. They just track a single object and combine their results without considering the relationship between the targets. Some tiny summary of high citations papers are as follows, and as the number of targets increases, FPS will drop sharply, and the advantages of the CF method will be lost.
